# batoj4

*batoj4* - Bayesian analysis of temporal order judgements - will be a Python module for the analysis of temporal order judgements (TOJ), an experimental paradigm in perception research based on PyMC4. PyMC4 is still under heavy development. Consequently, this project will first focus on input/output, visualization, and simultion of TOJ data. Estimation and inference (for which PyMC3 prototypes exist) will be added later.
